# Butterfly Distribution Project
# ISTA 422
# Fall 2017
# Maintainer: Adrianna Salazar

This project is focused on creating a Butterfly Species Distribution Model and an interactive mp visualizaation based on the specifications of two clients, KatyPrudic (klprudic@email.arizona.edu) and Jeff Oliver (jcoliver@email.arizona.edu). The project will begin by first collecting data from eButterfly and iNaturalist, then developing software to clean and parse through the data (the SDM) which will culminate in creating the desired visual. As the project goes on, this readme.md will fill with more information.
